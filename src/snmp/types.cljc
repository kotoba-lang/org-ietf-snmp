  "The SNMP-specific ASN.1 types: RFC 1157 §3.2 / RFC 1155-SMI's
  `NetworkAddress`/`Counter`/`Gauge`/`TimeTicks`/`Opaque`, RFC 2578 §7.1.6's
  `Counter64`, and the RFC 3416 §3 varbind exception markers
  (`noSuchObject`/`noSuchInstance`/`endOfMibView`).

  Every one of these is an ordinary ASN.1 element with an unusual tag: the
  five SMI application types are `[APPLICATION n] IMPLICIT` re-tags of a
  primitive that already exists (INTEGER or OCTET STRING), and the three
  exception markers are `[n] IMPLICIT NULL` under the CONTEXT class. Both
  reuses go through `asn1.core/retag`, which is exactly the seam it was
  built for: build the universal element with the existing constructor, then
  swap the tag. No second BER/length/OID codec lives here — see the
  `deps.edn` comment and the README for why.

  `ObjectSyntax` (RFC 1157 §3.2 / RFC 1902 §7) is the CHOICE of all of the
  above plus a bare OID; `encode-value`/`decode-value` are that CHOICE's
  encoder and decoder, keyed on a `:snmp/type` keyword rather than on the
  wire tag, because the tag alone does not distinguish e.g. `Counter32` from
  `Gauge32` (RFC 1155-SMI gives them different APPLICATION numbers, 1 and 2,
  so the tag *does* distinguish those two — but nothing on the wire says
  \"this INTEGER is a plain SNMPv2 `Integer32`\" versus \"this INTEGER is a
  MIB value with no SMI type at all\"; both are simply the universal INTEGER
  tag.  The keyword is the caller's declared intent, not a wire artifact.)"

;; first, extracted with `unsigned-bit-shift-right` + `bit-and` and rebuilt
;; with `bit-shift-left` + `bit-or`. Getting the shift amounts backwards is
;; the classic way to turn 192.168.1.1 into 1.1.168.192.
